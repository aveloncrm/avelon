## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project follows a modern microservices architecture with 3 separate applications:

### **apps/admin** - Admin Dashboard
The admin panel for managing products, orders, users, and other administrative tasks.
- Port: `8888` (development)
- Tech: Next.js 15, React Server Components
- Purpose: Internal management interface

### **apps/storefront** - Customer-Facing Store
The public e-commerce storefront where customers browse and purchase products.
- Port: `7777` (development)
- Tech: Next.js 15, React Server Components
- Purpose: Public shopping experience

### **apps/api** - Centralized API Server
A standalone API server that serves both the admin panel and storefront.
- Port: `9999` (development)
- Tech: Next.js 15 API Routes, Drizzle ORM
- Purpose: Centralized backend logic, database access, authentication

### Why 3 Apps?

**Separation of Concerns**: Frontend (admin & storefront) and backend (API) are completely separated.

**Independent Scaling**: Each app can be deployed and scaled independently based on traffic.

**Better Security**: The API can have its own security rules, rate limiting, and access controls.

**Easier Maintenance**: Changes to the API don't require redeploying frontends and vice versa.

**Single Source of Truth**: One API serves multiple clients, ensuring consistency.

### Deployment

When deploying with Vercel or similar platforms, create 3 separate deployments:

1. **API Server**: Root Directory = `apps/api`
2. **Admin Panel**: Root Directory = `apps/admin`
3. **Storefront**: Root Directory = `apps/storefront`

Make sure to set the appropriate environment variables for each deployment, especially `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` for the admin and storefront apps pointing to your deployed API server.

## üîê Authentication

The authentication is handled using JWT tokens stored in cookies and verified inside the `middleware.ts` file. The middleware function takes in the HTTP request, reads the `token` cookie and if the JWT is successfully verified, it sets the `X-USER-ID` header with the userId as the value, otherwise the request is sent back with 401 status.

## üëÅ‚Äçüó® Environment variables

Environment variables are stored in `.env` files. By default the `.env.example` file is included in source control and contains
settings and defaults to get the app running. Any secrets or local overrides of these values should be placed in a
`.env` file, which is ignored from source control.

Remember, never commit and store `.env` in the source control, just only `.env.example` without any data specified.

You can [read more about environment variables here](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables).

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Getting Started Locally

Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sesto-dev/next-prisma-tailwind-ecommerce
```

Navigate to each folder in the `apps` folder and set the environment variables.

```sh
# In apps/api
cp .env.example .env

# In apps/admin  
cp .env.example .env

# In apps/storefront
cp .env.example .env
```

### Environment Setup

**API Server** (`apps/api/.env`):
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/ecommerce"
JWT_SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key-here"
ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:7777,http://localhost:8888"
```

**Admin Panel** (`apps/admin/.env`):
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://localhost:9999"
JWT_SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key-here"
```

**Storefront** (`apps/storefront/.env`):
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://localhost:9999"
JWT_SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key-here"
```

### Install Dependencies & Setup Database

Get all dependencies sorted.

```sh
bun install
```

Set up the database (run from `apps/api` directory):

```bash
cd apps/api
bun run db:push
```

### Run All Applications

You need to run all three applications simultaneously:

```sh
# Terminal 1 - API Server
cd apps/api
bun run dev  # Runs on http://localhost:9999

# Terminal 2 - Admin Panel  
cd apps/admin
bun run dev  # Runs on http://localhost:8888

# Terminal 3 - Storefront
cd apps/storefront
bun run dev  # Runs on http://localhost:7777
```

### Access the Applications

- **Storefront**: http://localhost:7777
- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:8888
- **API**: http://localhost:9999

For more detailed information about the new architecture and migration from the old structure, see [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](./MIGRATION_GUIDE.md).

## üîë Database

Drizzle ORM can use any PostgreSQL database. [Supabase is the easiest to work with.](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started-postgresql) Simply set `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file to work.

### `bun run db`

This project exposes a package.json script for accessing drizzle via `bun run db:<command>`. You should always try to use this script when interacting with drizzle locally.

Available commands:
- `bun run db:generate` - Generate migrations from schema changes
- `bun run db:migrate` - Apply migrations to database
- `bun run db:push` - Push schema directly to database (development)
- `bun run db:studio` - Open Drizzle Studio for database management

### Making changes to the database schema

Make changes to your database by modifying `apps/api/src/db/schema.ts`.
